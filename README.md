This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to using `document.querySelector("p")` in JavaScript after dynamically adding a new paragraph element to the HTML DOM. The bug is that `document.querySelector("p")` selects the first paragraph element found in the HTML, even after a new paragraph element is added dynamically.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect styling of the DOM elements.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly select and style the newly added paragraph element.
